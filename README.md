Tic-Tac-Toe game.

This is a training repo to learn about new hooks feature of React and creating a testable environment.

- Separation between State Management and UI
- Minimal dependency
- CSS in JS based on `styled-components`
- **No** class components
- Uses `useReducer` hook to manage **state actions**
- Decoupled state logic (Actions)
- Optimized performance with `useCallback` and `memo`
